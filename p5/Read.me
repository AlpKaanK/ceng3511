When you run this program, it will show you a graphich which is about k-mean algorithm. The graphich displaying is running by "matplotlib" library.  If you have not "matplotlib" library yet, you can download it from "https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/". Also if you want to change value k, go to line 227.(It should be 5 at max and 2 at least).
